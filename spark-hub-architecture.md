# Spark Hub - AI Knowledge Management Initiative

## Overview
**Project**: Spark Hub  
**Organization**: Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield  
**Status**: Q4 2025 Launch Target (90-day pilot planned)  
**Role**: Product Lead & Architect (Designated Pilot Lead)

## The Challenge
Sales and retention teams at Anthem BCBS face significant productivity bottlenecks when accessing critical information during customer interactions:

- **Time-Intensive Lookups**: Finding the right department number takes 1-3 minutes per call
- **Information Fragmentation**: Critical data scattered across PDFs, emails, and slide decks
- **Missed Sales Opportunities**: Agents unaware of valuable programs like Integrated SEP
- **Compliance Risk**: Inconsistent guidance leading to CTMs and disenrollments
- **Agent Frustration**: Multiple systems and outdated documentation create confusion

## The Solution
Spark Hub is a centralized AI-powered dashboard where agents can select the right AI assistant for their specific needs - whether it's Phone Directory, SEP Eligibility, Process Guide, or other specialized helpers. Each assistant provides accurate, contextual answers in seconds.

## Key Benefits & Impact

### Operational Efficiency
- **85% Faster Information Retrieval**: Reduce lookup time from 3 minutes to ~30 seconds
- **10-12 Agent Hours Saved Weekly**: On misrouted calls alone
- **Reduced Repetitive Questions**: Less clutter in team chat channels

### Business Outcomes
- **Increased Sales**: Better awareness and real-time application of programs like Integrated SEP
- **Stronger Retention**: On-the-spot troubleshooting prevents cancellations
- **Compliance Protection**: Centralized, up-to-date guidance reduces CTMs and protects Star Ratings
- **Improved Agent Satisfaction**: Single reliable source replaces scattered resources

## Pilot Implementation Plan

### 90-Day Phased Approach
1. **Prep (Days 0-5)**: Baseline KPI snapshot, secure platform access
2. **Build (Days 6-30)**: Document ingestion, prompt refinement, MVP development
3. **Soft Launch (Days 31-45)**: Train 20% of pilot agents, gather feedback
4. **Full Pilot (Days 46-75)**: Expand to 100% of Loyalty agents, weekly KPI reporting
5. **Evaluate (Days 76-90)**: Final KPI comparison, lessons learned, scale-up recommendation

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Average Handle Time (AHT)**: Core efficiency indicator
- **Mis-transfer Resolution Time**: Measuring reduction from 2-4 minutes to 30 seconds
- **Integrated SEP Utilization**: Proxy for sales lift and agent education
- **Compliance Escalations/CTMs**: Protection of Star Ratings
- **Agent Satisfaction Score**: Adoption and usability signal

### Validation Results
- **99% Answer Accuracy**: Achieved across 175 comprehensive test scenarios
- **Proof of Concept**: Successfully demonstrated in 3 days with working prototypes
- **Stakeholder Buy-in**: Secured leadership support for pilot program

## My Contributions

As Pilot Lead, I am responsible for:
- **Product Strategy**: Conceived the Spark Hub concept and overall solution architecture
- **Technical Leadership**: Developed working POCs in 3 days demonstrating core functionality
- **Prompt Engineering**: Creating and refining AI prompts for accurate responses
- **KPI Framework**: Establishing measurement plan and success metrics
- **Stakeholder Management**: Securing buy-in from leadership and coordinating with cross-functional teams
- **Day-to-Day Ownership**: 100% dedicated to pilot success for 90 days

## Risk Mitigation

### Built-in Controls
- **Confidence Thresholds**: If answer certainty <90%, bot links to proper documentation
- **PHI Guardrails**: No PII stored; prompts limited to policy content
- **Human Review Loop**: All new documents reviewed before ingestion
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful handling when confidence is low

## Why This Matters

Spark Hub represents a practical, high-impact application of AI technology that:
- **Empowers Agents**: Provides tools to serve customers more effectively
- **Drives Measurable ROI**: Clear time savings and productivity gains
- **Scales Sustainably**: Built to grow with organizational needs
- **Protects Compliance**: Reduces risk while improving accuracy

The project demonstrates how thoughtful AI integration can transform daily operations, creating value for agents, customers, and the organization as a whole.

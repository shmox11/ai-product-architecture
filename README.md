## Product Development Methodology

### LLM-Assisted Development Framework
Developed and validated a methodology for AI-enhanced product development:
1. **Product Definition**: Clear requirements and success metrics
2. **Architecture Planning**: Technology stack and system design
3. **LLM-Generated Implementation**: Structured prompting for rapid development
4. **Iterative Refinement**: User feedback integration and technical optimization

**Results**: Tiny Triumphs built and deployed in 2 weeks, Living Resume full-stack application with enterprise-grade architecture.

## Career Transition Focus
